# @ensforge/contracts

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 4ebad9b: Support viem versions from 2.49.0 and use a peer dependency in the contracts package so applications can share their installed viem version.

  Keep V1 names visible when both indexers are enabled. Interpret indexed migration flags as ENSv1-to-ENSv2 migration rather than the historical V1 registry migration.

  Include names without a recorded expiry in expiryAfter filters, with consistent local filtering and pagination on the V2 indexer. Upper expiry bounds continue to require a recorded expiry.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d82878: Migrate Sepolia ENSv2 to the October 1 deployment snapshot 07e55a05. Update contract addresses and deployed ABIs, export the ENS URI renderers and VerifiableFactory address prediction, and refresh the indexer schema and migration guides. Mainnet behavior is unchanged.

  Support idempotent HCA deployment: preserve verification of existing accounts after deployment approval is revoked, reject unapproved new deployments, and report account reuse when deployments race. Recreate Sepolia fixtures and HCA accounts for the new factory, keeping workflow state separate from earlier deployments.

  Update the pinned devnet build and preserve the deployed Solidity submodule revisions rather than replacing them with revisions from the stale upstream lockfile.

  Require Effect 4 stable (`effect@^4.0.0`) and migrate HTTP and reactivity imports to their new export paths. Upgrade the React Atom integration to 4.0.0 and preserve HCA funding status return types with the updated Effect inference.

  Applications upgrading from the release candidate must install `effect@^4` alongside ensforge. Update any direct imports from `effect/unstable/http` and `effect/unstable/reactivity` to `effect/http` and `effect/reactivity`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- afe2eab: Migrate the Sepolia ENSv2 profile to deployment snapshot 71a3b733, including deployed ABIs, resolver permissions and record setters, registration, registry transfers, and HCA upgrade sets.

  HCA sessions now use reusable owner-signed authorization proofs rather than an on-chain enablement transaction. Pass the returned proof through the session authorization when executing with Rhinestone. Recreate Sepolia HCA accounts and fixtures for the new factory; old deployment workflow state and session proofs are not compatible.

  Add deployment verification commands, a pinned local devnet build, and updated playground setup and migration documentation. Mainnet behavior is unchanged.

  Sepolia Permissioned Resolver grants now require explicit scope-widening consent because record-key roles apply across names. Public-key writes and bulk record clearing are unsupported on that resolver. Registry transfers remain safe by default and expose an explicit unsafe-transfer option for compatible registry workflows.

  Fix Rhinestone stateless-session signing and validate HCA registrar token approvals against the current rent oracle, including mintable Sepolia test tokens. Update HCA funding examples to distinguish registration token balances from refund and cross-chain funding. Decode the new ENSv2 resolver record-update event formats and refresh live migration fixtures.

  Refresh the Sepolia V2 GraphQL schema and generated operations. Include record-model updates in general event-history filters and decode EAC role changes from their resulting bitmap, including complete revocation. Allow schema refreshes for a single protocol.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e48eedc: Add HCA account inspection, EntryPoint deposits and owner-authorized withdrawals, signature verification, and upgrades with both directional gate checks. Expose factory, upgrade-gate, and trusted-set governance through hca/admin and sdk.hca.admin. Include exact deployed ABI fragments and an explicit function-coverage catalogue.
- 77bca68: Add the pinned Sepolia HCA deployment profile, runtime verification metadata, and focused factory,
  account-inspection and validator-wiring ABI fragments under the v2 export. Unsupported public
  networks are rejected; provider and cross-chain compatibility remain unverified.
- b9073ba: Add 16 HCA account, deployment, owner-execution and tracking actions with the existing sdk.hca group.
  Support direct atomic owner transactions and an explicit execution adapter boundary without wallet
  fallback. Add matching execution ABI fragments, profile configuration, session revocation, and
  validated submission tracking. Provider packages and session execution remain future work.
- 8aa0bb6: Add the Pimlico owner execution adapter using permissionless, with optional ETH sponsorship,
  first-operation HCA deployment, bounded fee reviews, and on-chain UserOperation receipt tracking.
  Expose the deployed EntryPoint execution fragment and explicit counterfactual owner verification.
- 47095d1: Add fixed-policy HCA destination sessions and a Rhinestone execution adapter. Core exposes owner
  enablement, bounded refunds, enabled-status reads and confirmed session references. Session plans
  validate complete calldata and reconcile expiry, replacement and nonce revocation.

  The optional Rhinestone subpath requires SDK 1.8.0 with the shipped compatibility patch. It supports
  prefunded same-chain destination execution, SDK signing, on-chain signature verification and
  restorable public intent tracking. Hosted relayer settlement remains a release verification step.

### Patch Changes

- 0a68e20: Align HCA execution with verified Sepolia provider behavior: record the intent executor adapter, validate same-chain signature envelopes against the reviewed nonce, bound session-history log requests, and check Pimlico self-funded prefunds. Review packed cross-chain token IDs and pin proxy implementation storage alongside contract bytecode. Reject unsupported source-funded destination quotes before signing; token-paid Rhinestone refunds remain outside the supported release boundary.
- d9025fa: Correct the Sepolia V2 HCA validator and standalone implementation addresses against the pinned post-audit-2 deployment artifacts. Update deployment provenance; the 32 complete deployed V2 ABIs already match this snapshot.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- aed1b6d: Move package repository metadata and release provenance to the Namespace GitHub organization.

## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 1f829bd: Support Wagmi 2.19 and 3.x, including RainbowKit applications, and point package homepages to
  ensforge.com.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 94e55fe: Align the Sepolia ENSv2 deployment, contract interfaces, initializer fragments, interface IDs, and
  renewal execution with the contracts deployed from the pinned July source snapshot. Remove
  forward-looking interface and contract-batch renewal exports that are not available onchain.

## 0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f93c0d: Release the initial production-ready ensforge packages.
