# @ensforge/sdk

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 4ebad9b: Support viem versions from 2.49.0 and use a peer dependency in the contracts package so applications can share their installed viem version.

  Keep V1 names visible when both indexers are enabled. Interpret indexed migration flags as ENSv1-to-ENSv2 migration rather than the historical V1 registry migration.

  Include names without a recorded expiry in expiryAfter filters, with consistent local filtering and pagination on the V2 indexer. Upper expiry bounds continue to require a recorded expiry.

- Updated dependencies [4ebad9b]
  - @ensforge/core@0.6.1

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d82878: Migrate Sepolia ENSv2 to the October 1 deployment snapshot 07e55a05. Update contract addresses and deployed ABIs, export the ENS URI renderers and VerifiableFactory address prediction, and refresh the indexer schema and migration guides. Mainnet behavior is unchanged.

  Support idempotent HCA deployment: preserve verification of existing accounts after deployment approval is revoked, reject unapproved new deployments, and report account reuse when deployments race. Recreate Sepolia fixtures and HCA accounts for the new factory, keeping workflow state separate from earlier deployments.

  Update the pinned devnet build and preserve the deployed Solidity submodule revisions rather than replacing them with revisions from the stale upstream lockfile.

  Require Effect 4 stable (`effect@^4.0.0`) and migrate HTTP and reactivity imports to their new export paths. Upgrade the React Atom integration to 4.0.0 and preserve HCA funding status return types with the updated Effect inference.

  Applications upgrading from the release candidate must install `effect@^4` alongside ensforge. Update any direct imports from `effect/unstable/http` and `effect/unstable/reactivity` to `effect/http` and `effect/reactivity`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- afe2eab: Migrate the Sepolia ENSv2 profile to deployment snapshot 71a3b733, including deployed ABIs, resolver permissions and record setters, registration, registry transfers, and HCA upgrade sets.

  HCA sessions now use reusable owner-signed authorization proofs rather than an on-chain enablement transaction. Pass the returned proof through the session authorization when executing with Rhinestone. Recreate Sepolia HCA accounts and fixtures for the new factory; old deployment workflow state and session proofs are not compatible.

  Add deployment verification commands, a pinned local devnet build, and updated playground setup and migration documentation. Mainnet behavior is unchanged.

  Sepolia Permissioned Resolver grants now require explicit scope-widening consent because record-key roles apply across names. Public-key writes and bulk record clearing are unsupported on that resolver. Registry transfers remain safe by default and expose an explicit unsafe-transfer option for compatible registry workflows.

  Fix Rhinestone stateless-session signing and validate HCA registrar token approvals against the current rent oracle, including mintable Sepolia test tokens. Update HCA funding examples to distinguish registration token balances from refund and cross-chain funding. Decode the new ENSv2 resolver record-update event formats and refresh live migration fixtures.

  Refresh the Sepolia V2 GraphQL schema and generated operations. Include record-model updates in general event-history filters and decode EAC role changes from their resulting bitmap, including complete revocation. Allow schema refreshes for a single protocol.

### Patch Changes

  - @ensforge/core@0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ced8e8: Support custom ENS V1 and V2 deployment profiles in Viem and Wagmi configuration. Validate chain IDs and complete contract address groups, snapshot custom deployments, and avoid inheriting preset indexer endpoints. Resolved network IDs and chain IDs now support arbitrary deployments; runtime deployment provenance is optional.
- f53985c: Default SDK instances to their own memory workflow storage, and React providers created from config
  to lazy IndexedDB storage. Preserve caller-supplied storage and SDK instances. Keep the Effect service
  context when adding default storage to an existing core config.
- e48eedc: Add HCA account inspection, EntryPoint deposits and owner-authorized withdrawals, signature verification, and upgrades with both directional gate checks. Expose factory, upgrade-gate, and trusted-set governance through hca/admin and sdk.hca.admin. Include exact deployed ABI fragments and an explicit function-coverage catalogue.
- 0943f56: Add the optional HCA adapter package with typed execution envelopes, versioned tracking codecs,
  review and fee policies, and capability extensions. Preserve provider submission types through the
  SDK and add shared bounded execution waiting/watching with cancellation and receipt confirmation checks.

  Reserve type-only Rhinestone and Pimlico entrypoints for the initial provider integrations.

- b9073ba: Add 16 HCA account, deployment, owner-execution and tracking actions with the existing sdk.hca group.
  Support direct atomic owner transactions and an explicit execution adapter boundary without wallet
  fallback. Add matching execution ABI fragments, profile configuration, session revocation, and
  validated submission tracking. Provider packages and session execution remain future work.
- 9bef00b: Add resumable same-chain HCA registration with caller-owned revision-checked storage, explicit
  spending limits, atomic registration and resolver grants, optional primary-name setup, and safe
  submission reconciliation. Expose start, get, resume, and local cancellation on the existing SDK.
- 47095d1: Add fixed-policy HCA destination sessions and a Rhinestone execution adapter. Core exposes owner
  enablement, bounded refunds, enabled-status reads and confirmed session references. Session plans
  validate complete calldata and reconcile expiry, replacement and nonce revocation.

  The optional Rhinestone subpath requires SDK 1.8.0 with the shipped compatibility patch. It supports
  prefunded same-chain destination execution, SDK signing, on-chain signature verification and
  restorable public intent tracking. Hosted relayer settlement remains a release verification step.

- c1e8c43: Add shared config workflow storage with memory and IndexedDB adapters, generated workflow IDs,
  automatic unfinished-operation recovery, transaction checkpoints, and workflow inspection and
  reconciliation. Preserve explicit resume and legacy HCA storage while allowing HCA registration
  and independent Rhinestone funding to use config storage.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a5f4353: Add group-scoped Core and SDK type entrypoints, slim the SDK and React root type surfaces, and
  resolve workspace packages through generated declarations to improve editor IntelliSense. Import
  action-specific SDK types from `@ensforge/sdk/<group>`.

  Wagmi integration now uses the optional `@ensforge/core/wagmi` and `@ensforge/sdk/wagmi`
  entrypoints, so viem-only consumers no longer install Wagmi. Sequential write plans retain submitted
  transaction hashes across confirmation failures and resume without resubmission.
